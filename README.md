Components:
For the components I choose to use an Analog stick for the ghosts movement allowing movement in all directions. I also added 2 buttons to add additional abilities for the ghost, including the ability to place a brick wall with 1 button, and the ability turn invisable during when pac man has a power pellet, each can be used once per match. I also added an RGB LED that can change colors. Its purpose is that it changes color depending on which ghost your playing. The LED will also turn dark blue when pac man gets the power pellet and the ghosts become vulnerable.

For my custom made shell, I made it a more controller friendly shaped version of the ghosts. Trying to implement controller comfort while keeping the iconic ghost shape.

Assembly: 
The controllers electronic components are screwed into the base to hold them in place. The base itself is screwed into the main lid from the bottom, the lid makes up majority of the surface area that the player is holding. If players wanted to modify the controller they would jus need to unscrew the screws and they can get to the inside easily.
